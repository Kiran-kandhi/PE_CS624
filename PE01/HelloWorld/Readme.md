Input:
When a user launches the mobile app, they can do so by scanning a QR code or opening it directly on their device.

Process:
Upon opening the app, it displays static information in a distinct style.
The background color of the View component is set to red, creating a visually distinctive look.
Text elements within the app are styled with a specific font size, font weight, and margin settings. 

Output:
The app output shows the user's name as "Kiram Reddy Kandhi," their degree program as "CS624 MSCS," and the school they are affiliated with as "STC," all presented on the distinctive red background. This design choice provides a clear and visually appealing way to convey this specific information to the user.
