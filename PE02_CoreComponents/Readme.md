Input:
The program primarily relies on user interactions, specifically capturing the text input when users specify their preferred course in the designated input field. Additionally, it requires the presence of an "icon.png" image file within the "./assets" directory to function correctly. These two inputs, the user's course selection and the image file, are essential for the program's proper operation.

Process:
The core function of the program revolves around presenting content on the screen. It accomplishes this by leveraging fundamental React Native elements such as View, Text, ScrollView, Image, and TextInput. The program's logic is encapsulated within a functional component represented by an arrow function.


Output:
The program generates a visually appealing and well-structured mobile app interface. The program provides users with access to CityU's course catalog through an external link, enabling them to access additional data. In summary, the program produces a user-friendly mobile app that showcases MSCS courses and empowers users to customize the information displayed about these courses.
